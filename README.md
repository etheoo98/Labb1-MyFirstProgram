# Labb1-MyFirstProgram
C# console application made for yet another beginners programming course. 

## Assignment description
* Create a new project in Visual Studio (Console Application → C# → .NET Core)
* Set the project name to "MyFirstProgram"
* Create a variable that saves a number of your choice (you don't need to ask the user for a number, you can enter it directly in the code)
* Create an If statement that checks if your number is over 10.
* If the number is over 10, print the text "The number is large!" otherwise print "Oops. Low number!"
* Print the text "What is your name?" and let the user enter their name
* Print "Hello name!" where name is replaced with the name entered by the user
* Create a loop that prints all the numbers from zero up to the number you put in your previous variable.
* Put some comments in the code that briefly explain what it does.
* Add a comment at the top of the code with your name and class.

## Example
Here is an example of what it might look like when your program runs in the console if the number was 11 and the user entered the name Tobias.
```
The number is large!
What is your name?
Tobias
